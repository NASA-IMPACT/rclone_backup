Method for backing up Google Drive contents to S3 using rclone

# Installation

## Linking google drive

### Prerequisites

- By default rclone will use an internal key for connections to Google Drive. This is lower performance. If possible obtain a key by following this guide: https://rclone.org/drive/#making-your-own-client-id

- If the files you are attempting to copy come from a shared drive make sure to configure the remote connection as a Shared Drive when prompted.

- The setup shown below assumes the client running rclone has access to a web browser. If using a headless machine or a remote machine with no access see the following configuration methods: https://rclone.org/remote_setup/

### Process

Start by running:

```
rclone config
```
Then follow the guide below:
```
No remotes found, make a new one?
n) New remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/r/c/s/q> n
name> <remote-name>
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Google Drive
   \ "drive"
[snip]
Storage> drive
Google Application Client Id - leave blank normally.
client_id>
Google Application Client Secret - leave blank normally.

Scope that rclone should use when requesting access from drive.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Full access all files, excluding Application Data Folder.
   \ "drive"
 2 / Read-only access to file metadata and file contents.
   \ "drive.readonly"
   / Access to files created by rclone only.
 3 | These are visible in the drive website.
   | File authorization is revoked when the user deauthorizes the app.
   \ "drive.file"
   / Allows read and write access to the Application Data folder.
 4 | This is not visible in the drive website.
   \ "drive.appfolder"
   / Allows read-only access to file metadata but
 5 | does not allow any access to read or download file content.
   \ "drive.metadata.readonly"
scope> 1
Service Account Credentials JSON file path - needed only if you want use SA instead of interactive login.

Remote config
Use web browser to automatically authenticate rclone with remote?
 * Say Y if the machine running rclone has a web browser you can use
 * Say N if running rclone on a (remote) machine without web browser access
If not sure try Y. If Y failed, try N.
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
Configure this as a Shared Drive (Team Drive)?
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> n

## Linking S3

### Prerequisites

- While AWS credentials can be entered into rclone directly it is more secure to create a dedicated rclone user in AWS
